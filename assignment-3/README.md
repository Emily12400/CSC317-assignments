# Assignment 3
## In this assignment, the focus is on Git and GitHub's basic functions. :octocat:

### The students are required to take two short courses offered by GitHub in this homework.

1. [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) 
2. [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown) 

The instructions to finish these courses are clearly stated in each course's repo. 

#### Deliverables: A PDF report with two URLs


**Make sure your report's first page has your NAME and STUDENT ID in the header.**

After finishing each of the above two courses, you will end up with a repo that is similar to the image below. 
After finishing these two courses, you will end up with **two repositories in your name on GitHub**.
You are asked to create a **hyperlink** to each repo in a single line in a PDF report. 


I need to be able to click on each link on your PDF and be directed to that repo's address. 

Your report will include your name + ID number in the header. And, two single URL hyperlinks on a single PDF report page. Submit that to Canvas, please.

> [!WARNING]
> If I cannot click on the URL link on your PDF report becuase you did not make it into a hyperlink, I will give you zero marks when I grade this assignment's report.
