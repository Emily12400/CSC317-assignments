The content of this table is your top three coding resources that you have found very useful in your computer science journey. These resources can be of any media: social media channels, books, blogs, websites, Discord channels, etc.

You may find this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) very useful for this pat of the assignment.

### favicon.svg
#### General Info
Per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Favicon):

>   A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.
>   It is a usually a high-contrast image. There are free tools to create a favicon.


For a long time, SVG could not be used to create faicon since it was not supported by browsers. However, it is now widely supported by different browsers. You are asked to create a high-contrast favicon.svg file in this part of the assignment using your own drawings or any tool. 


To include the favicon.svg in your website, you need to include the following in the <head></head> of each of your html files:

```<link rel="icon" href="path-to-your-favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">```

Don't forget to update the relative path to your favicon.svg in the above code snippet. 

A few helpful resources on favicon: 
-  [SVG, Favicons, and All the Fun Things We Can Do With Them](https://css-tricks.com/svg-favicons-and-all-the-fun-things-we-can-do-with-them/)
-  [Bilding an adaptive favicon](https://web.dev/articles/building/an-adaptive-favicon#:~:text=This%20means%20if%20an%20SVG,light%20and%20dark%20user%20preferences.)
