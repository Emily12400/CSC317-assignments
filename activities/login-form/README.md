# Activity: Create a Styled Login Form

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:

In this activity, you will create a simple login form using HTML and CSS. The form will include:

An email input for the username, which must be validated as a proper email format.

A password input for the userâ€™s password.

A submit button with a cool background color, padding, and border radius.

A container div with a stylish background and rounded corners.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a better understanding of HTML form elements, CSS styling, and input validation.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions:

### 1. Set up your HTML file:

Create a new file and name it login-form.html.

Add the standard HTML structure ```(<!DOCTYPE html>)```.

Inside the ```<body>```, create a ```<div>``` that will serve as a container for the form.

Make sure the ```<div>``` has a class attribute: ```class="login-container"```
### 2. Create the form structure:

Inside the ```<div>```, add a ```<form>``` element.

Within the form, include:

A label and an ```<input>``` for the username, setting its type to email.

A label and an ```<input>``` for the password, setting its type to password.

A submit button with a meaningful label like "Log In".

### 3. Style the form using CSS:

The container ```<div>``` should have:

A background color of off-white (#f8f8f8).

A ```border-radius``` of 10px to give rounded corners.

Some padding for spacing.

The submit button should have:

A cool background color (choose one you like!).

Padding for better size and appearance.

A border-radius for rounded edges.

### 4. Validate the email input:

Use the ```type="email"``` attribute in the input field to ensure users enter a valid email format.

This will automatically provide browser-based validation.

### 5. Test your form:

Open the HTML file in a browser.

Try entering incorrect and correct emails to see how validation works.

Check the appearance and responsiveness of your form.
