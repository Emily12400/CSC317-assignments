            <h2>Homenaje a la Neurocirug√≠a by Marta Colvin Andrade</h2>
            <p>Although Colvin is predominantly known for abstract themes that allude to pre-Hispanic symbols, this
                gigantic sculpture, an homage to neurosurgery, is one of her most recognizable public art pieces.</p>
