# E-Commerce Website Project

## Project Overview
Build a simple but complete E-Commerce website using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQLite**. Your website should allow users to browse, search, and purchase products. Think of this as a mini-version of Amazon, Etsy, or Ebay.

This project is designed to be beginner-friendly but still allow creativity and personal flair.

## Minimum Requirements

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: SQLite (stored locally)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no need to use a templating engine like Pug or EJS)
- Authentication: Login and registration with password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
- GitHub Repository with active collaboration from all team members
- Deployed at least to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

### Core Features (Required)
- [x] **Storefront Page**: A home page displaying a list of available products (minimum 12 products)
- [x] **Login/Registration Page**: Users must be able to create an account and log in
- [x] **Product Detail Page**: Clicking on a product shows details, including title, image, description, and price
- [x] **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by name or keyword
- [x] **User Profile Page**: Displays user information and purchase history
- [x] **Navigation Bar**: Appears on all pages with links to Home, Login/Profile, Cart, etc.
- [x] **About Page**: Brief information about your fake company
- [x] **FAQ Page**: Answers to common questions (e.g., refund policy, shipping info)
- [x] **Shopping Cart + Payment Page**: Users can add items to cart and "purchase" (mocked checkout)
