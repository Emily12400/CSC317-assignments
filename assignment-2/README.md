Assuming you got access to a Linux Ubuntu OS machine that you were supposed to make in the previous assignment, this assignment will ask you to download a few files from this same repository onto your Ubuntu machine. Then, you are asked to create a node server and modify the included HTML files by way of answering some questions about Node.js and Express web framework. As always, come to our dicord channel to exhcnage ideas and troubleshoot. 

### Instructions
1. download the files in this diretory to your machine
2. create a directory on your home directory called _CSC-317_ using the terminal CLI
3. move or copy the downloaded files in step.1 to directory _CSC-17_ 
4. change your working directory to directory _CSC-317_ that you made in step.2
5. if you have VScode, run (that period symbol is important!)
     ```
   code .
     ````
     to open the content of CSC-317 inside VScode
   note: if you prefer other editors, feel free to use whatever you like. But, this write-up assumes you are using VScode.
6. make sure you have node.js installed by running on your terminal commandline
   ```
   node -v
   ```
   if nothing shows up, you need to install node. source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04
